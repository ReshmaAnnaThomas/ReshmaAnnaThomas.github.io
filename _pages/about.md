I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate at West Virginia University. I work with [Dr. Sarah Burke-Spolaor](https://sarahspolaor.faculty.wvu.edu/) on [Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst) and other radio transients. I am also a part of the [realfast](http://realfast.io/about/) collaboration at the [Very Large Array (VLA)](http://www.vla.nrao.edu/). My research focuses on searching for fast radio transients in both time- and imaging-domain data, localizing, characterizing, and figuring out where they came from and what produces them. I use the radio frequency data from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the VLA for my research. 

You can see my publications [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/OUKtvXIFR6C-5THj23_Apw) or on the Publications Tab on the top right. 

I was born and brought up in a small southern Indian State called [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala), where I did my schooling till 12th grade. 
Driven by my passion for Physics, I moved to a little town called [Pondicherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry), about 550 km from my hometown, to pursue a 5-year Integrated M.Sc in Physics. Pondicherry is a union territory of India and is a coastal town which was once a French colony. After my Master's degree, I flew to West Virginia, USA, to study radio astronomy!

My family was supportive throughout every step of my life, and I consider myself lucky for that. I want to use my privilege to raise awareness among underprivileged people about the importance of education and financial independence, especially among women.
