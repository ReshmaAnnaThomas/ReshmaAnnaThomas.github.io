I am a third year Ph.D Student at West Virginia University. I work with [Dr. Sarah Burke-Spolaor](https://sarahspolaor.faculty.wvu.edu/) on [Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst). I am also a part of the [realfast](http://realfast.io/about/) collaboration at the [Very Large Array (VLA)](http://www.vla.nrao.edu/).

You can see my publications [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/OUKtvXIFR6C-5THj23_Apw) or on the Publications Tab on the top right.
